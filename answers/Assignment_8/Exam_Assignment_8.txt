1. Explain the naming conventions for intrinsic functions.
(_<vector_size>_<operation>_<suffix>)

- <vector_size> : it refers to the size of the vector extension that is being used,
there are 3 options, mm for 128-bit vectors(SSE), mm256 for 256-bit vectors(AVX(2)), and mm512 for 512-bit vectors(AVX-512)

- <operation> : Explains which operation the vectors are going to do

- <suffix> : identifies the datatypes used within the vectors

2. What do the metrics latency and throughput tell you
about the performance of an intrinsic function?

- latency : The amount of cycles the intrinsic function needs until it's result is available.

- throughput : The amount of cycles needed, until the intrinsic function can do another instruction

3. How do modern processors realize instruction-level
parallelism?

- Instruction Pipelining : Enables multiple execution of different instructions partially overlapping

- Out of Order Execution : Performs execution based on the availability of the input data, not based on the order of the program itself

- Branch Prediction : Tries to predict whether a branch (for example, in an if statement) was taken or not. The branch that was taken is then 
run with speculative execution.

- Speculative Execution : The processor, based on history (memory dependence prediction for example)
in some cases, will try to execute the code after the branch without evaluating the branch. Then it will decide to dispose of the result or not
based on whether the branch was taken or not.

4. How may loop unrolling affect the execution time of
compiled code?

- It is able to do speed ups, in some cases by some factors.
However, it comes with a great cost, such that it will cause increased compile times, program sizes, and space usage(in the instruction cache).
May also have a higher demand for registers.

5. What does a high IPC value (instructions per cycle) mean
in terms of the performance of an algorithm?

- It means that it is performing Instruction Level Parallelism(ILP). This is a very efficient
usage of the CPU. With higher IPC, the lower amount of cycles needed to go through all of the instructions.
