1. Explain three vectorization clauses of your choice that
can be used with #pragma omp simd.

- simdlen:
Sets how many vector register that you want to use in your computation. It may negatively affect performance. Usually it is an optional clause.

- reduction:
Perform a correct reduction operation for a computation. It will output the correct result at the end.
OpenMP does not support min() and max() operation in terms of reduction.

- collapse(n):
Collapse multiple for loops, such that it is possible to run nested for loops in parallel.

2. Give reasons that speak for and against vectorization
with intrinsics compared to guided vectorization with
OpenMP.

- for:
-> more control for the programmer
-> similar performance on multiple compilers (performance portable).

- against:
-> Harder to use
-> Intrinsics data type and intrinsics functions are dependent on the architecture of the processor


3. What are the advantages of vector intrinsics over
assembly code?

- the advantages of vector intrinsics are that, they are more portable, such that different compilers and operating systems
can perform the same way.

- No need to explicitly assign each of the registers.

- Better readability and it is easier to learn.

4. What are the corresponding vectors of the three
intrinsic data types: __m256, __m256d and __m256i.

- __m256:
8 float numbers

- __m256d:
4 double numbers

- __m256i:
different kind of integers, either signed or unsigned
