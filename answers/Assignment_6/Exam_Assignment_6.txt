1. Name some characteristics of the instructions sets:
SSE, AVX(2) and AVX-512.

- SSE:
-> Introduced in 1999.
-> Contains 70 new instructions compared to the original x86 architecture instruction set
-> Has xmm0-xmm7 vector registers, each 128 bits larger
-> Only capable of four 32-bits single-precision floating point numbers(later expanded in SSE2)
-> allows 2 operands format


- AVX(2):
-> AVX was first introduced in 2011 and AVX2 was first made in 2013
-> supports 256 bits 
-> uses 16 YMM registers
--> each register can perform eight 32 bit single precision floating point numbers original
    four 64-bit double-precision floating point numbers
-> More instructions in AVX and even more in AVX2
-> allows 3 operands SIMD instruction format, called VEX coding scheme.

- AVX-512:
-> allows 4 operands SIMD instruction called EVEX prefix
-> supports 512 bits
-> Number of register is increased from 16 to 32 (renamed from YMM to ZMM)
-> More instructions



2. How can memory aliasing affect performance?

- The compiler is able to do optimizaton such as vectorization 
when it can determine whether the memory location is unique

3. What are the advantages of unit stride (stride-1)
memory access compared to accessing memory with
larger strides (for example, stride-8)?

- The compiler will be able to access the code faster and it will make it easier to vectorize


4. When would you prefer arranging records in memory as a
Structure of Arrays?

- When we want to do computation with multiple arrays utilizing our vector registers. 
It helps the vector register in accessing the memory elements with stride 1 for each of the element.
