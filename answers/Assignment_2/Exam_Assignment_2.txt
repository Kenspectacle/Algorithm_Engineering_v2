1. What causes false sharing?

-Each processor has its own local cache. False Sharing happens when 2 processors tries to use data from the same cacheline. 
The data in both processor must be updated in order to maintain cache coherency

2.How do mutual exclusion constructs prevent race
conditions?

3.Explain the differences between static and dynamic
schedules in OpenMP.

4.What can we do if we’ve found a solution while running
a parallel for loop in OpenMP, but still have many
iterations left?

5. Do the coding warmup on slide 22. Explain in your own
words how std::atomic::compare_exchange_weak
work

6.Rewrite the parallel program for estimating π from the
last exercise to use the construct #pragma omp for
