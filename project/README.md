## Efficient Image Filter Using OpenMP

This is a project made to implement image filtering and enhancing algorithm in a highly efficient manner. The main idea is to utilize the advancement in hardware parallelism by utilizing multiple threads in a parallel program and vectorization.

By Kenny Gozali and Walter Ehrenberger, as a submission for the course algorithm engineering by Markus Blacher??? no thats not his name.
